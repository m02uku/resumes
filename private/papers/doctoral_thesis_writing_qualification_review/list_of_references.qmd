## Conclusion

This bibliography establishes the comprehensive knowledge foundation necessary for doctoral research on phonological features and representational units in the deep learning era. The 256 identified research works form a systematic knowledge base spanning symbolic traditions to modern neural approaches, providing essential theoretical and technical foundations for advancing computational phonology through innovative hybrid methodologies.

The literature survey reveals three major paradigmatic shifts: (1) from rule-based to constraint-based phonology, (2) from supervised to self-supervised learning, and (3) from purely symbolic or neural approaches toward integrated neuro-symbolic architectures. These developments create unprecedented opportunities for bridging linguistic theory with artificial intelligence, establishing the research context for this doctoral thesis proposal.

Key research gaps identified include the need for systematic comparative evaluation of representational units, development of interpretable neural-symbolic integration methods, and validation of cognitive plausibility in computational phonological models. The proposed research directly addresses these gaps through multi-dimensional optimization frameworks and hybrid architecture development, positioning this work to make significant contributions to both theoretical linguistics and practical speech technologies.
