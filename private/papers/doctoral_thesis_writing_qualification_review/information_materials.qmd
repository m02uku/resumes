## Thesis Title

**English Title:**
Phonological Features in the Age of Deep Learning: A Multi-dimensional Exploration of Optimal Representational Units for Language Modeling

**Japanese Translation:**
深層学習時代における音韻論の素性：言語モデル化のための最適な表象単位に関する多角的探求

## Thesis Abstract (200 words)

This research explores the fundamental question of "optimal representational units" in computational phonology. The study aims to integrate symbolic approaches (phonemes, distinctive features) with modern deep learning approaches (continuous representations from wav2vec 2.0 and related models) by proposing a neuro-symbolic hybrid model utilizing vector quantization technology. The research evaluates different representational paradigms across four dimensions: predictive accuracy, linguistic interpretability, cognitive plausibility, and computational efficiency. Through systematic comparison of continuous vectors, VQ codes, phonemes, and features across diverse phonological tasks, the study develops novel hybrid architectures that parameterize Maximum Entropy Harmonic Grammar using self-supervised learning representations. The cognitive plausibility is validated through developmental simulations using CHILDES corpus and ABX discrimination tasks. This work contributes to both theoretical linguistics and practical AI applications by establishing a new phonological representation theory that bridges symbolic precision with neural learning capabilities, advancing the integration of linguistic knowledge with data-driven machine learning for next-generation speech technologies.

## Research Overview

This doctoral thesis represents computational linguistics research that multi-dimensionally explores the optimality of representational units in phonology against the backdrop of rapid deep learning technology development. The study aims to bridge traditional symbolic approaches with modern neural network approaches through three major research questions:

1. **Empirical Landscape Elucidation (RQ1)**: Systematic comparative evaluation of different representational units
2. **Neuro-symbolic Integration (RQ2)**: Design and validation of hybrid architectures
3. **Cognitive Plausibility Validation (RQ3)**: Consistency evaluation with human language acquisition patterns

The research originality lies in proposing novel modeling methodologies that integrate symbolic precision with neural learning capabilities, aiming for interdisciplinary contributions through the fusion of linguistic theory and AI technology.
