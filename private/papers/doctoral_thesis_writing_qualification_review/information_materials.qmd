# Thesis Abstract

This doctoral thesis investigates the fundamental question of optimal representational units for computational phonology in the deep learning era. The research addresses the critical gap between traditional symbolic phonological theories (distinctive features, phonemes, constraints) and modern neural representations learned by self-supervised models like wav2vec 2.0 [@baevski2020wav2vec]. Through a multi-dimensional evaluation framework encompassing predictive accuracy, linguistic interpretability, cognitive plausibility, and computational efficiency, the thesis pursues three interconnected objectives: (1) empirically mapping the landscape of different representational units across diverse phonological tasks, (2) developing neuro-symbolic hybrid architectures that integrate symbolic knowledge with neural learning [@panchendrarajan2024Synergizing; @begus2020Generative], and (3) validating cognitive plausibility through language acquisition simulations and behavioral comparisons [@cruzblandon2023Introducing].

The research employs systematic experimentation using multilingual speech corpora [@cho2025Sylber; @ardila2020Common], implements novel architectures combining self-supervised encoders with constraint-based decoders [@tesar1995Computational], and validates findings against human language processing data. Preliminary results demonstrate that discrete neural codes can maintain 85% performance while enabling symbolic manipulation [@higy2021Discrete], and that neural-parameterized Maximum Entropy Harmonic Grammar can discover phonologically meaningful constraints without supervision. Expected contributions include a unified theory of phonological representation, practical improvements in speech technology through interpretable hybrid models, and interdisciplinary insights bridging linguistics, machine learning, and cognitive science.
