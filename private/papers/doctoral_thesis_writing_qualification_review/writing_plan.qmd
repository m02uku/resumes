## Considerations for Research Implementation

### Quality Management System

- Monthly supervisor meetings for progress management
- Regular interim presentations at laboratory seminars
- External evaluation through active submission to international conferences and academic journals
- Interdisciplinary discussions with researchers from other fields

### Risk Management and Alternative Plans

**Technical Risks**: Utilizing cloud computing and incremental experimental design to address computational resource shortages

**Data Risks**: Securing multiple alternative data sources in case of difficulty accessing primary datasets

**Theoretical Risks**: Pursuing theoretical contributions through individual approaches in parallel, in case of poor hybrid model performance

### Building International Research Networks

- Promoting collaborative research with overseas research institutions
- Active research presentation and networking at international conferences
- Qualitative improvement of research through discussions with renowned researchers

Following this writing plan, I aim to establish a new paradigm in computational phonology for the deep learning era and complete an academically and socially significant doctoral thesis.
